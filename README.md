# Microsoft Azure SIEM Honeypot Project 2024

## Project Objectives

- Set up a honeypot on Microsoft Azure.
- Expose the honeypot to the internet.
- Monitor and document RDP connections.
- Analyze the data collected by the honeypot.
- Investigate traffic from specific IP addresses.

## Overview of the Project

 1. Create a **Free Azure Account** (with $200 in free credits for the first month)
 2. Set up a new **Virtual Machine** in Azure to use as the honeypot for the project.
 3. Create a new **Log Analytics Workspace** to aggregate the event logs from the Virtual Machine.
 4. Set up **Azure Sentinel** with Azure. (Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM).
 5. Create a **SIEM dashboard** in **Azure Sentinel** for viewing log data.
 6. Use queries in **Logs** tab of **Log Analytics Workspace** to investigate specific incidents in more detail
 7. Show results and document the importance of security principles.
